# The reason a linear solution is unintuitive is that, as you loop through the array, you need to know the maximum height
# to the left AND to the right, to know how much the current position can trap. How to know without backtracking?
# 
# If it was possible, it requires a two-pointer solution.
# 
# The trick:
# - As you move, keep maximums on both sides: left_max & right_max.
# - EUREKA: Only move the pointer that has the smaller maximum ðŸ¤¯!
# - This way, you know how much water the current position can trap: `min(left_max, right_max) - height[current]`

# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(1)
