// profit, buying at first timestamp and selling at last is exactly the same as buying and selling at every pair.
// So this should be as trivial as computing an array of differences between subsequent numbers, & âˆ‘ the positive ones.

// Strategy looks like it works well on the examples:
//
// [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4] becomes [-6, 4, -2, 3, -2]: 4+3 = 7
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] becomes [1, 1, 1, 1]: 1+1+1+1 = 4
// [7, 6, 4, 3, 1] becomes [-1,-2,-1,-2]: 0
